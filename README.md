the detail on configuration of dlib [CSDN blog](http://blog.csdn.net/insanity666/article/details/72235275)

The program contains two part, training and prediction. There are some examples in code.

How the program runsï¼Ÿ
* get the feature: img->68 face landmark->face attriveness feature(face ratio,more detail in[SCUT-FBP-paper](http://www.hcii-lab.net/data/SCUT-FBP/EN/introduce.html))
